We joined Koding's Hackathon for the opportunity to learn and be a part of a large community. This Hackathon will prove individual skills and provide ways for us mentor each other to improve in areas that we lack. Collaborating with various individuals from around the world on similar tasks is a fun and educational way to learn coding as well as create something innovative.
